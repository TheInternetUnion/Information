# General/About

## What is the Internet Union?
The Internet Union is a non-profit organization to give the people of the Internet a voice against governments worldwide.
As the Internet continues to grow, namely the World Wide Web, governments are introducing unfair restrictions upon it, often against the views of the users and general populace.

## Why is it needed?
Many different websites have user-created content that promotes the same message we do. However, this is not a universal way, and will only be seen by a small number of people.
The Internet Union allows for an easy way to join together to protect the Internet we all use.

## Should we trust you?
We're not going to say that you should trust us, that's up to you to decide. We will do our best to be transparent and democratic in many processes.
